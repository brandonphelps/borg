# Intro

This repo is more or less a collection of software related technologies. 
Specifically those that I've learned and have implemented, these
are either done by reading others source code or specification documents and
have typed out. 

The intent behind a mono repo was purely the desire that all the components
of the pieces I've learned could be smooshed together in some sort of
abomination of tech. I've done similar things of rust setting up
lua bindings which provide terminal to type lua code that calls
into rust functions to do database updates. 

This repo will be more structured and will have modules
associated to areas that I think make sense. 

The ordering that i work on this will be purely done via
what ever is of interest to me at the moment. 

If any of the subcomponents is of interest feel free
to copy it and re-use, however no guarentee of it being
protocol compatible is made.
